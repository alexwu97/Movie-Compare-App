# Movie Browser Web App

#### Deployed in Netlify: [alexmovie.netlify.app](https://alexmovie.netlify.app/)

This application lets users find movies and look up information regarding it. The movies are fetched from TMDB's APIs using search library Typeahead and Bloodhound search engine. This application idea was inspired from [[github.com/SKempin/reactjs-tmdb-app]](https://github.com/SKempin/reactjs-tmdb-app) with an add-on of allowing a choice to show multiple movie displays to compare side by side.

A toggler allows users to have 1 or 2 movie displays on at the same time. Simply by selecting either display will let you search the movie and display it on the selected display. Feel free to check it out!
